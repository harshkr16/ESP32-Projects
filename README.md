Activity detection using RSSI of wifi using ESP32 board
In this project, i have tried to detect the activity like "SITTING", "STANDING" AND "WALKING". i have made my laptop to work as a Transmitter and the esp32 board as a Reciever.
The activity is detected within LOS(Line Of Sight) of Rx and Tx.
The distance maintained between the Rx and Tx is 2m.
